Hey, /b/. Okay, so, she was playing her new copy of Pokemon: Pearl for the DS when I saw her again last night. After filling me in on what'd happened in the game since I last saw her, and commenting on how stupid she thought Team Galaxy's haircuts were, she lapsed into a somewhat more depressed mood, then looked down and said, "I'm such a loser. I can't even play with other people when they build a wireless mode into it.".

Which, naturally, made me feel bad for multiple reasons. Bad enough that I told her I could probably find some people that wanted to play with her on the internet, the only problem being that they were strangers, and that I knew she already knew about strangers on the internet (from her pre-accident days of using it under the supervision of her parents). Still...it had me wondering if the rewards may outweigh the risks. What do you think?

You can find people on the internet in places other than /b/. It would be completely retarded to post it here.

If you do, don't identify her, just do it in an "ITT friend codes" manner.

That was the plan, if it seemed at all feasible on other fronts. I wasn't planning to ID her as, well, who she is. The big issue is the voice chat, and the sort of messages and text communication one can engage in over wifi.

I've been thinking lately, why don't you give nintendo a shout about your story?

Well, she apparently swept the grass gym with just her star-something bird. It seems she couldn't find any fire types, and 'the penguin sucks', so she gave up and just went in with that one, and, well, pulled it off. I thought it was pretty funny, in a cool sort of way. Then she found the fire pony a half hour or so later.

Comming down to it, for this to even happen, we would need some direct contact with you or her.

Because starting a thread everytime she wants to play will get old and annoying. We won't be on all the time. And as you said, next time you see her is 8 hours away.

Do not look to /b/ for playmates for ampu-tan. While it is true that some of us (myself included) actually care about her in a non-pooper way, the vast majority would just be assholes to her. And you damn well know that anybody here is gonna let it slip that you've been telling stories about her all this time, even if it's accidental. And of course it will be blown all out of proportion - say goodbye to chances of adoption.

I meant more for battling and such than traded nicknames. I've heard a lot about seakings named 'Fuck Yeah!' for instance. Of course, living in a hospital, then with a lot of older people with diminishing mental faculties, not to mention health care workers, who are as prone to swearing under their breath as anyone, she's heard enough dirty words to bring her up to speed and desensitize her already...

Nurse-kun, 'nother thought I had:

Remember seeing a message from another amputee saying they didn't like receiving help, as it made them seem out of control and helpless.

I was thinking that getting her a pet, probably something shit like a fish that doesn't require handling or whatever (can be looked after one handed : /) might be good, might prove that her existence is unbelievable important to someone other than you and the whole of /b/ it seems.

maybe fish not allowed in hospital though :(

Yeah, any pets, even little goldfish equivilants, aren't allowed at the home...there have been a few visits from one of those 'pets for seniors' programs that bring animals by for a visit every now and then, but she's always stayed at the back of the room and refused to participate when it happened...I think 'losing' her kitty when she lost her home after the accident is still too painful to ignore so far.

She hasn't nicknamed even one of her pokeymans as far as I can tell, either. I'm not sure if it's connected, though...

For the record. She was using the internet a fair amount before the accident, as makes sense for an intelligent young girl from an intelligent young family of professionals. The parents making up the rest of said family having educated her on the perils of the internets, and how to remain safe from said perils whilst surfing the highway, to mix metaphors. She already knows there are 'bad people' out there, as we (she and I) have in fact discussed, when I told her there was a possibility of getting friends codes from said internets. She isn't a wideeyed retarded naif from Amish country, nor a sheltered mystic named after a precious stone, people, even if she is still a child, and thus not nearly fully aware of precisely what constitutes the 'bad stuff' people can do.

Oh, and to follow this up: Since the only computer access available in the facility is for the staff, at workstations and in offices (the policy is not so up to date as to provide internet access to the old people in our place, no siree), her DS is still pretty much her only internets-capable device available to her (possibly to any patient).

If you really want her to play with people on the Internet:
1) It should be girls, because they're less likely to be total assholes.
2) You should find them through a normal gaming channel, not through /b/.

i am intrigued. You must talk like you were asking a stranger the time, but then slip in a 'btw, sup b?'
depending on response, dont freak out. ask if he is a caretaker or a nurse, maybe give him your phone number or email address, and promptly leave. supposing it is him and he finds you decent enough, you'll get a call or email. in a perfect world, of course.

That, or he'll come to your place and brutally murder you in your home, then use his experience in the ER and the OR to dismember your corpse and dispose of it in an untracable manner!

Maybe.

The penguin does not suck. The turtle sucks.

The penguin did seem to suck, from what she showed me. Some 20 power bubble attack, and pound and stuff at level 15? It's no mudkip (which seems to have been her favorite from the previous generation, daughter of /b/ that she is...).

Well, if by 'healthy', you mean 'not sick with an infection of some sort', then yes.

Holy shit a Nurse-kun thread I am actually here for!

Bud if I had pokemon (and a DS), I'd sure be up for playing her. Alas, I don't have either, except for an old version of Blue and Red and my old GB color. *sigh* 

That said, it would probably be unwise to give out her friend code or whatever (forgive me for not knowing how it works, like I said I don't have a DS), too many immature /b/tards in the masses, I'm afraid. You dont want to risk anything, not just for you being found out, but for her own sake. With her sensitive nature and overall damaged mental state (hope that term doesnt offend you, but i cant really describe it otherwise), you dont want to risk someone saying something to here, text message or otherwise, that would hurt her. I mean, with the idiots in /b/, I'm sure half the people would want to say something along the lines of "SUCK MY COCK BITCH". Don't risk it.

Few questions for you if you have the time pal:

1. Kind of relating to the thread, but how has Amputan been doing as far as being more open around you and others? I'm sure you two are progressing, but it sure as hell would be sad if she keeps herself closed off from her emotions. From what I have read on the wiki, she even has a hard time looking you in the eyes when she is talking about something emotional. Poor girl.

Question 2: How's she feeling now? Last I checked, she chilled at your place for some R&R. It's nice that they allowed you to do that.

Question 3: Any chance you can post the recipe of the soup? I can go for some right now, if I dont seriously fuck it up with my horrible cooking skills.

Last Question: Any updates on the adoption process? Has she ever mentioned she would want to go to your place again for a while, to get out of the home or whatnot?

Epic thread. Best of luck to both you, its real nice you take such good care of her. The girl needs it.

*commence "gtfo emofag" posts from the trolls.

1) Still damaged. I can only accept it, try to be understanding, and attempt to help with her repairs.
2) She's all better, and back to her chipper, energetic, non-coughing and queasy self. I'm glad it worked out all right on the SW and administration side as well.
3) I'm sorry, I don't have it on me, as it's my mom's recipe and she hasn't taught it to me yet (just my sisters). I'll try and get ahold of it, though.
Still ongoing, no change from my last thread-time. We went on a picnic on wednesday, and I'm considering something for either tomorrow or monday, depending on scheduling, weather, difficulties with my dad, etc. Nothing about my place in particular, other than telling me I should dust more.

also, you could try out the friend codes playing instead of her for a few sessions to check them out before deciding whether or not the people behind the codes are decent or not.

Something I've considered, doing a little 'undercover as loli' work, though I'm not sure how well I'd pull it off, and, well. I don't think I'd pass very well, chief. You don't know what it's like out on those streets, chief! You don't know what they'll do, who they'll cut, who they'll sell, just to get their hands on another fresh loli!! I ain't going out there unprotected!
