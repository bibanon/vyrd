				<p>(Apparently, you don't know your own users...)</p>

				<p>I did send you several e-mails about this in the past but they apparently  
				got ignored. I hope that you will read and consider this, in case you  
				actually never got the old e-mails. Or maybe reconsider it, if you did and  
				just ignored them.</p>

				<p>None of us like each other, obviously, but I still seriously propose that  
				we set up some sort of mutual link exchange. This would obviously cut down  
				on any spam to the level of "few trolls trying to stir up a war", and  
				hopefully, not even that would happen after a while.</p>

				<p>I actually used to have a free banner text for 4chan, linking to "/b/"  
				with a text such as "Tired of using your brains? Relax and enjoy images."  
				(or something alone those lines). I would be prepared to bring that back,  
				as well as removing all the banned phrases related to "4chan". In return,  
				I expect you would put a rotating text or graphical banner (doesn't  
				matter) on the 4chan boards. It doesn't need to get heavy "weight" or  
				anything, as long as it sticks around and is permanent.</p>

				<p>I really think that this would solve a ton of problems and I frankly  
				cannot imagine why you would turn this offer down at this point.  
				Hopefully, you will not. We don't need to like each other. The two boards  
				obviously serve completely different needs, and I would very happily get  
				rid of "sloppy" posters who just want to use memes and such. At the same  
				time, I do recognize that there are people with brains surfing your board,  
				and nothing stops them from using both.</p>

				<p>As I suggested the last time, I'm OK with rather "unflattering" ad texts  
				such as: "Feeling anal-retentive? Then check out AnonTalk.com!". However,  
				it would be nice if we could agree on the specifics. I'm prepared to do  
				this within hours.</p>

				<p>Think about it. Nobody (or at least much fewer) would have a reason to  
				spam/"raid" either board if both link to each other, while agreeing to  
				disagree.</p>

				<p>Excitedly awaiting your response.</p>

				<p>Right. You apparently choose to ignore the real issue and assume things in  
				order to dismiss this very serious proposal.</p>

				<p>I really thought that you would see things differently, but apparently  
				not. In a few days, AT is two years old and it would have been a great  
				"fresh start" to not have any chantards constantly coming there to scream  
				and post junk due to "spam" in threads.</p>

				<p>You think advertising is free on AT? It's not. I was (and still am, but  
				not for long) prepared to give you a prominent backlink as well, but you  
				seem completely uninterested in this.</p>

				<p>It would be a simple matter of displaying a small link randomly on every  
				Xth page load across the boards. If you don't already have such a system  
				in order, which I believe you do, it would be extremely easy to code.</p>

				<p>The offer still stands, but this really is the last time I'm going to try  
				to reason with you. I actually do have better things to do than sending  
				fruitless e-mails.</p>

				<p>(I can make a small custom graphical banner if you want, and you can get a  
				(static) image banner as well.)</p>

				<p>No, that's not it. It's: "If both of us link to each other's board, which  
				are not in direct competition, this should finally stop most/all problems  
				related to attacks and counter attacks."</p>

				<p>> Am I missing something here?</p>

				<p>Yes. I must say that I thought that you would either not respond at all,  
				or do respond positively.</p>

				<p>Do you have any idea how much money, time and grey hairs your users and  
				their damn attacks have cost me? You let them go on. I'm saying that I'm  
				willing to look past that for the greater good, but you insist on being  
				hostile. I won't start praising 4chan all of a sudden -- I think its users  
				have done far more damage to the Internet than anything else -- but it  
				can't be denied that it's got traffic, with a certain number of posters  
				who would also make great "AnTs", and that's why I care.</p>

				<p>If you don't respond to this, or yet again ignore what I write, I'll know  
				that you're not interested, and in that case, I will give up all attempts  
				to talk to you and won't contact you again. Otherwise (and I really hope  
				that this will be the case), I can have the 4chan ad active very quickly.  
				You don't need to make a big deal out of it (such as announcing it in any  
				way) if you fear user reactions.</p>

				<p>You are not REQUIRED to permit illegal content on your servers. You just
				DON'T WANNA remove it. You don't FEEL like it, because you don't like me,
				my Web site, my "tone" or whatever reason you might have for keeping this
				"game" up. I'm not stupid. If you actually wanted to, the site would be
				gone within nano seconds. You choose to keep this psychopath because you
				want to make it difficult for me.</p>

				</p>This is typical. WHY do you have to keep making my life an obnoxious hell?
				I have WORK to do; I can't spend all my time dealing with these fucking
				uncooperative companies that don't know their own good.</p>
				
				<p>I won't send you any more documents. You will either remove the illegal
				content from your God damn server OR face the consequences. I am DONE
				filling out these bullshit forms and sending them in to you and other
				people who don't even read them. Handle this immediately or you'll regret
				it. I promise you this. This is not an empty threat by some nobody -- it
				is a serious matter which will eventually run your company into
				bankruptcy. It may take some time, but I will not forget this.</p>

				<p>PS: I have no idea who you are and I don't have anything against
				you personally. My issue is with your company and how you are handling
				legitimate abuse complaints.</p>

				Subject: Illegal clone of my software hosted on your servers: tiny.4chan.org (URGENT!)</p>
				<p>Dear OC3 Networks,</p>

				<p>The owner of the domain 4chan.org, "moot", has, I believe for what must be  several months now, been hosting http://tiny.4chan.org/ on your servers. 
				It is an illegal, unauthorized verbatim clone of my original, copyrighted, closed 
				source work http://www.AnonTalk.com/. My board was unique and started in 
				early 2008. This board was put up a few days ago, in year 2010, and has 
				copied everything from the structure and messages to ideas and feature. It 
				is hidden underneath a shell that is supposed to look somewhat different, 
				however, in order to fool people looking into abuse complaints such as 
				this one. Yes, it sounds unlikely, but this person is a dangerous thief 
				and psychopath and, together with his "crew" of Internet "trolls", has 
				been harassing me for years.</p>

				<p>I have sent many e-mails to him, but he ignores them entirely or sends 
				mocking replies back. The owner of the domain is known as a copycat and 
				the entire Web site 4chan.org (cloned of a Japanese BBS) revolves around 
				copyright violations and organizing illegal "raids" and harassments of 
				people in real life and on the Internet. The Web site's userbase has been 
				very seriously harassing our board for over two years now with daily spam, 
				"trolling" and DDoS attacks, all organized on 4chan.org and allowed, 
				encouraged and sometimes *initiated* by the "creator" (I wouldn't call it 
				"creating" when you just copy and paste a concept).</p>
				
				<p>The clone in question, which is the main part of my complaint, incorrectly 
				claims copyright of the software and has a fake copyright year stated in 
				the meta data (and possibly on the board itself -- I refuse to check it 
				any longer). This is obviously inaccurate and just one of the many 
				attempts to damage us.</p>

				<p>I have carefully read up on your AUP, ToS and legal documents, and 
				American law, and it is completely clear to me that you are required not 
				only by your own policies, but the actual law, to remove 4chan.org from 
				your servers, effective immediately. The next best thing, as far as we are 
				concerned, is for you to get this person to at least remove the subdomain 
				"tiny.4chan.org", as this is separate from the main site. The main site is 
				not violating our specific IPs, and may continue in a "worst case" 
				scenario as far as we are concerned. (Although it is still illegal and 
				violates your policies and many laws; you may want to look into that 
				separately when we are done with each other.)</p>

				<p>Our only demand is that either you convince the owner to remove the 
				illegal subdomain board, or remove all hosting for 4chan. If you comply, 
				no legal action will be taken toward OC3 Networks.</p>

				<p>Should you still continue to ignore this request, legal action will very 
				soon be taken toward OC3 Networks. We take this extremely seriously and 
				will demand a large amount of money for all the damages that your client 
				(and, by proxy, you) has caused us in terms of uptime, goodwill, labor and 
				intellectual property damages.</p>

				<p>Your sincerely,<br />
				AT Sysop.</p>
				</ol>
				<br /><hr />
				<h3>I think that's about it. Kimmo has sent all sorts of great e-mails to Jan Martin of Tinychan,
				most of which are on Encyclopedia Dramatica. He's also posted all sorts of crazy bulletins on his site, 
				which are also archived in various places.</h3><br />
